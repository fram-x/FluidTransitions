## Introduction
This project aims to implement a simple yet powerful set of constructs for building fluid transitions between elements when navigating with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org). 

The library is JavaScript only - no linking required.

The library implements a new navigator component called `FluidNavigator` with the same interface and routing configuration as the `StackNavigator`. The library has a component called `Transition` which can be used to build different types of transitions that will automatically be run when navigating between screens using the regular navigation actions.

> The Navigator's API is identical to the StackNavigator except that it does not support a header component. It can easily be integrated with redux and your existing navigation setups.

## Installation

To install the library into your project, run yarn or npm:

`yarn add react-navigation-fluid-transitions`

or

`npm i -S react-navigation-fluid-transitions`

Compatible versions with `react-navigation`:

| react-navigation-fluid-transitions        | react-navigation |
| ----------------------------------------- |:----------------:|
| 0.3.x                                     | 3.x              |
| 0.2.x                                     | 2.x              |
| 0.1.x                                     | 1.x              |

> Future improvements and development will be on react-navigation-fluid-transitions@0.3.x.

## Examples
Examples are included in the project and should be runnable from the root of the project folder.

To start the example run the following commands from the terminal:

`npm i` or `yarn`

To start the project run

`react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

### Shared Element Transitions
This example shows how two elements can be set up to automatically transition between each other when navigating between screens. A more detailed edition of this example can be found in the file [SharedElements.js](./Examples/SharedElements.js).

> Note that a shared transition happens between two elements that looks the same. The library animates position and scale between the two hence using different styles and content between the two elements will result in strange transitions.

```javascript
const Screen1 = (props) => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <Text>Screen 1</Text>
    <View style={styles.screen1}>
      <Transition shared='circle'>
        <View style={styles.circle}/>
      </Transition>
    </View>
    <Button
      title='Next'
      onPress={() => props.navigation.navigate('screen2')}
    />
  </View>
);

const Screen2 = (props) => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <Text>Screen 2</Text>
    <View style={styles.screen2}>
      <Transition shared='circle'>
        <View style={styles.circle2}/>
      </Transition>
    </View>
    <Button
      title='Back'
      onPress={() => props.navigation.goBack()}
    />
  </View>
);

const Navigator = createFluidNavigator({
  screen1: { screen: Screen1 },
  screen2: { screen: Screen2 },
});

```

### Transitions
The library also supports transitions for elements wrapped in the `Transition` component. You can provide appear/disappear transitions that will be animated during navigation.

The `Transition` element supports appear and disappear transitions (appear will be used if disappear is not set), and these can either be one of the predefined transitions - or functions where you provide your own transitions.

```javascript
<Transition appear='scale' disappear='bottom'>
  <View style={styles.circle}/>
</Transition>
```

#### Transition Types

| Name        | Description | 
| ----------  | ------------- | 
| scale      	| Scales the element in and out | 
| top      	| Translates the element in/out from the top of the screen | 
| bottom | Translates the element in/out from the bottom of the screen | 
| left | Translates the element in/out from the left of the screen | 
| right | Translates the element in/out from the right of the screen | 
| horizontal | Translates the element in/out from the left/right of the screen | 
| vertical | Translates the element in/out from the top/bottom of the screen | 
| flip | Flips the element in/out | 

#### Custom transitions
It is easy to provide custom transitions - just add the transition function to your component's appear or disappear property. The following example creates a transition that will scale in from 88 times the original size of the wrapped component:

```javascript
<Transition appear={myCustomTransitionFunction}>
  <View style={styles.circle}/>
</Transition>

myCustomTransitionFunction = (transitionInfo) => {
  const { progress, start, end } = transitionInfo;
  const scaleInterpolation = progress.interpolate({
    inputRange: [0, start, end, 1],
    outputRange: [88, 80, 1, 1],
  });
  return { transform: [{ scale: scaleInterpolation }] };
}
```

Read more about the parameters and functionality for building [custom transitions](./docs/CustomTransition.md).

### Native driver support
For achieving the best experience it's vital to get rid of JS evaluation during animation run. React-native Animated API allows for scaling in both axis using native drivers, but it's not possible to resize width and height (which calls for a layout computation). Thus the native driver is used only when the ratio of source and target component are the same and it's recommended for the best quality of animations.
